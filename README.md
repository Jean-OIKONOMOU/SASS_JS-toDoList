# What is this ?
A simple ToDo list application that will be using :
- **SASS** for responsiveness on all devices (from smartphones to 4K displays) .
- *Persistent* Data through the usage of the **Web Storage API**.
- [**A11y accessibility**](https://www.a11yproject.com/ "Getting started with a11y compliance").for people with disabilities (keyboard navigation and screen readers).

# Why does this exist ?
To train myself in the aforementioned technologies.

# Where can I see it ?
In progress...

P.S. : I'm using Vim for the first time while developing this web app.
